CREDIT SCORING SYSTEM 

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-driven credit scoring system to enhance credit risk analysis in the financial sector. Traditional credit scoring methods often rely on limited financial metrics, leading to suboptimal outcomes and an inability to dynamically monitor credit risk post-approval. This project addresses these limitations by creating a system that is both adaptive and inclusive, tailored to the diverse needs of financial institutions.

The system employs a comparative analysis of two models: Logistic Regression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability, and XgBoost, a powerful ensemble learning algorithm known for handling complex, non-linear relationships. By evaluating these models on metrics such as predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and computational efficiency, the project identifies the most effective approach for varying banking scenarios.

In addition to improving the accuracy of credit risk predictions, the system introduces continuous credit risk monitoring, enabling early detection of potential defaults and dynamic adjustments to risk management strategies. This scalable and flexible solution aims to reduce risks, optimize lending decisions, and support data-driven strategies, representing a significant advancement in adaptive credit scoring methodologies for the financial sector.
